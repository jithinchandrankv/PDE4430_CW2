#           MOBILE ROBOTICS

## PDE4430_COURSE WORK 2

## Objectives

   To design a  mobile robot to move 3 different spheres into the ‘pen’ formed by two walls using teleoperator mode or autonomous mode.The robot needs to have a URDF file which defined to load into Gazebo in the simulation and be able to move and interact with objects in the simulation. 

## Design

  According to objective, design a robot with two fingure can move the different sizes of spheres to the destination.
