#           MOBILE ROBOTICS

## PDE4430_COURSE WORK 2

## Objectives

   To design a  mobile robot to move 3 different spheres into the ‘pen’ formed by two walls using teleoperator mode or autonomous mode.The robot needs to have a URDF file which defined to load into Gazebo in the simulation and be able to move and interact with objects in the simulation. 

## Design

  According to objective, design a robot with two fingeres can move the different sizes of spheres to the destination.

To move different size of spheres, created robot with 3 wheel,Its a balanced robot having 2 guides/fingers to guide balls to pen/destination.In that one wheel is caster wheel, it will help robot for balance while moving.Also added body support to attach visual system.

## Packages

For our course work we added  packages like Assesement world,myrobot and pde4430_cw1.
